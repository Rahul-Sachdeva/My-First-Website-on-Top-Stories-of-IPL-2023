<h1 class="Stories" id="Story2"> <li>DC, PBKS, SRH, KKR's another Failure</h1> 
    <img class="Storyimage" src="./2.) 4 Teams Failure.jpg">
    <p class="Storydata"> It was again a heartbreak for the
        fans of DC, PBKS, SRH and KKR as the teams,like PBKS 
        and KKR even after giving a glimpse of hope to their
        fans these teams again failed to qualify for the 
        playoffs, due to their inconsistencies in both
        batting and bowling departments. This was a 
        forgettable season for both DC and SRH as they 
        finished at the bottom of the table. The inavailabilities
        of some of their important players also proved to be a big problem
        for some of these teams. The hope is never over, as who knows,
        we might see some of these teams in the playoffs 
        next time around.
    <br><br>Standings:
    <br>KKR: 7th Place
    <br>PBKS: 8th Place
    <br>DC: 9th Place
    <br>SRH: 10th Place
    </p>
    </li>
    <h1 class="Stories" id="Story3"> <li>Season of the Most Hundreds</h1> 
        <img class="Storyimage" src="./3.) Most Hundreds.jpg">
        <p class="Storydata"> We can say this season to be 
            "The Season of the Hundreds" as we saw a big jump
            in the previous record of the most hundreds in a 
            single ipl season from 8 to 12. The Most Important
            of these came from Shubman Gill who scored 3 centuries
            in 4 games at the business end of the tournament. Then,
            there was Virat Kohli who finished the season with 2 
            consecutive Hundreds. The Other Centurions included the
            likes of H. Brooks, V. Iyer, SKY, Y. Jaiswal, H.Klassen,
            P. Singh and C. Green. This rapid increase is a result 
            of better pitches as well as better approach of the players.
        </p>
        </li>
        <h1 class="Stories" id="Story4"> <li>The Brilliant Opening Duos</h1> 
            <img class="Storyimage" src="./4.) Opening Duos.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> The season had some brilliant opening Duos
                including the likes of Virat-Faf, Butler-Jaiswal and 
                Conway-Gaikwad. While these players set up records for their partnerships, 
                some teams also struggled with choosing their openers like SRH,
                KKR and DC. We see that teams with better openers finished better at the points table.
                While the Virat-Faf Duo scored a record breaking 900+ runs in their partnerships, 
                the Conway-Gaikwad duo was not much behind with 800+ runs in their 
                partnerships.
            </p>
            </li>
            <h1 class="Stories" id="Story5"> <li>RR Lost Momentum after a strong start</h1> 
                <img class="Storyimage" src="./5.) RR Losing Momentum.jpg">
                <p class="Storydata"> Even after a strong start as well as a strong team,
                the 2022 season runner-ups failed to even qualify in this season's playoffs. 
                This was a result of their bad outings in the later half of the season, as well as the inconsistencies
                from their batters other than Jaiswal.
