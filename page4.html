            IPL is known for its big-money throughout the world, being one of the richest leagues of the world, but spending big money on players doesn't get you what you want, does it? Let's see. Sam Curran, the most expensive player in IPL history did good, but not as much as was expected from him. Cameron Green, the Second most Expensive Player was good with the bat but not that much with the bowl. Nicholas Pooran, he did the Best in expensive player category as he delivered at crunch moments, playing many impactful knocks throughout the season. 
            But, there was also a category who did not do well at all, which included the likes the Ben Stokes, Harry Brooks and Mayank Agarwal. So it's not the money but the player that wins you the matches.
