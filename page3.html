            <img class="Storyimage" src="./12.) Comeback of the Old Stars.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> Do you think epic comebacks aren't possible? SEE these Epic Stars who did as well as the young guns this season.
                These stars included A. Mishra, S. Sharma, I. Sharma who made some worth noticing contributions to their team's wins. 
                The Best of the Old Stars  included A. Rahane (made a valuable contribution to his team's title win), P. Chawla (who not only did come back strong, but also got his name in the top wicket takers) and finally, Mohit Sharma(not only the 2nd highest wicket taker but almost brought the title home for his team).

        <h1 class="Stories" id="Story13"> <li>LSG and MI exceed Expectations</h1> 
            <img class="Storyimage" src="./13.) LSG and MI.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> Despite losing the likes of one of their top scorers as well as their captain, KL Rahul, LSG was able to qualify despite not having many Indians with World reknown names thanks to their foreign superstars and young Indian bowlers. Similar to this was MI's story who finished last place the previous season, didn't had the services of J. Bumrah and with what looked like a poor bowling attack, got themselves up the table with their batting supremacy as well as working well with what their bowling had. It was amazing to see these two outperform many teams on many aspects.

        <li><h1 class="Stories" id="Story14">Yashasvi's Incredible Run</h1> 
            <img class="Storyimage" src="./14.) Yashasvi's Incredible Run.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> Yashasvi, the name does match with what he has done this season, piling up 626 runs in just 14 games, the most by an uncapped indian in IPL history. 
                Not only that, he also outperformed his co-opening superstar Jos Buttler, who was the top run getter last season. He did break the record for the fastest fifty in IPL in just 13 balls, Can you Imagine? Will this new superstar be seen in the Indian Jersey soon? I Hope so.
            </p>

        <li><h1 class="Stories" id="Story15"> Rinku's Mind Blowing Finishes</h1> 
            <img class="Storyimage" src="./15.) Rinku's Finishes.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> He is not Mahi, he isn't Russell, he's Rinku. The new Finishing Superstar of this Grand League, The IPL. He Not Just only hit 5 sixes in a row to win the game against GT to earn his name in the Superstars, But also did deliver on various churnch situations, to help KKR be in contention for the playoffs till the last game of the season, being the top run-getter for them.
                The Absolute brilliant was not a one time fluke, as he did deliver against PBKS, LSG, CSK and many more, whenever his team needed. Will this new blazing finisher be seen in this coming World Cup in the Indian Jersey Soon. Let's Hope so.
