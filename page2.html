            <img class="Storyimage" src="./9.) Qualification Scenarios.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> This season will be known for its competition between the teams to qualify for the playoffs.
                 As many as 8 teams, had the chance of qualifying till every team played its last match and only 1 team qualifying till then.
                 The main competition was between 4-5 teams including LSG, MI, RR, RCB and PBKS. Even with only 2 matches remaining, there were still 3 teams in contention
                 for the last remaining qualification spot, which was eventually bagged by MI as RCB lost their last match against GT.
            </p>

        <li><h1 class="Stories" id="Story10"> RCB fans to wait another year yet again</h1> 
            <img class="Storyimage" src="./10.) RCB not Qualify.jpg">
            <p class="Storydata"> 
                The Long-Lasting wait of the ever hopeful RCB fans still continues as RCB fail yet again to even qualify for the playoffs.
                 There was a great chance of RCB reaching the playoffs, thanks to their wins in the last 2nd and last 3rd match, but failing to win 
                 their last match against the really strong side GT got them out of the race of the playoffs. RCB fans didn't what get wanted, but would be happy to see their batting prowess in their KGF(Kohli, Glenn, Faf) who got their batting on line and Siraj leading their bowling 
                 department giving them the hope to win the title next time around.
